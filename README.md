## Overview

This is the front-end mentor's fourth challenge. The challenge is to build this of the Profile-card-component and make it as close to the design as possible. Building the desing with whatever you want to finish, any language, framework or tools.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- Build out the project to the designs provided

### What I learned

When we need to show only a part of an image, we should use overflow, but image with position defined as "absolute" does not suit "hidden" overflow well.
An alternative was to use position as "fixed"

```CSS
  #top {
  position: fixed;
  width: 978px;
  height: 978px;
  left: -750px;
  top: -600px;
}
#bottom {
  position: fixed;
  width: 978px;
  height: 978px;
  left: 150px;
  top: 294px;
  z-index: 1;
}

```

For the responsive design to be effective, it was necessary to use relative units based on the screen size, such as vw (viewport width) and vh (viewport height) which use the width and height of the viewport respectively. And for that I used the px conversion [calculator](https://it-news.pw/pxtovh/) for these measurements.

```CSS
  @media (min-width: 768px) {
  #top {
    position: fixed;
    width: 67.9166vw;
    height: 135.833vh;
    left: -20vw;
    top: -69.444vh;
  }

  #bottom {
    position: fixed;
    width: 67.9166vw;
    height: 135.833vh;
    left: 48vw;
    top: 52vh;
    z-index: 1;
  }
}

```
