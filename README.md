## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned (arrumar)

Sometimes keep measurements fixed and not just based on percentages. When all measurements are based on percentages, unwanted behaviors can occur that will cause you to get lost in the styling.
By using only percentages I found errors in my responsive design, and when I established fixed heights for content and cards, the design was much better suited to responsiveness, with only the width behaving as adaptable, while the cards had defined sizes.

```CSS
  @media (max-width: 928px) {
  .conteiner {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100vh;
    overflow: auto;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: inherit; /**/
  }

  .content {
    width: 87.2%;

    height: 132.6rem;
    background: white;
    margin: 88px 0 88px 0;

    display: inline; /*  */
  }
}

```
